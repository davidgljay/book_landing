          <h3>Movement Strategy</h3>
          <div>
            How might your organization strategically invest in relationship? Who might you inviting into relationship and how might you prepare for unpredictable but strategically relevant results? How is your organization already part of larger movements that share your values, and how might active participation in those movements further your mission?

            <h3>Relational Operations</h3>
            <div>
              Once you know who you want to invite into relationship how do you create the conditions for those relationships to flourish? This almost always requires an ecology of relational containers: large tentpole events interspersed with smaller more frequent gatherings. How do you build a robust ecology with limited resources?

          <h3>Relational Data Practice</h3>
          <div>
            Once youâ€™ve invested time and resources in building relationship how do you understand the impact of your work? How do you prove that impact to external stakeholders such as funders? How might we collect data about relational outcomes if those outcomes matter but cannot be predicted or controlled?
